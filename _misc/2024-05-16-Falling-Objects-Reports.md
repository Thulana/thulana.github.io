Recent news reports highlight multiple instances of objects falling from the sky, prompting concern and investigation. Scientists are tracking a significant, uncontrolled object estimated to weigh around 1,000 pounds, which is anticipated to crash-land on Earth soon [3, 11]. These reports come amidst incidents where unknown objects have already impacted terrestrial locations, including a case in New Jersey where a falling object caused damage to an auto shop [13]. Separately, a 35-pound object, potentially an airplane component, recently struck a car in Portland [7]. These events underscore the ongoing risks associated with falling debris, whether from space or aircraft.
