I'm just a guy with a crazy head who dabbles with a laptop and hitting the keys like i know what the hell i'm doing. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: Graduated from University of Moratuwa, Faculty of Engineering, majoring in Computer Science. Passionate about tech stuff even when i was young. Mostly games though. I did freelancing for more than 4 years, so i'm not that dumb, got few tricks up my sleeves.:wink: Enough about me, here are few things that i think i know,
* Languages : Sinhala and English of course. Apart from that Java, Python C, PHP, JavaScript 
* Programming jargon I know : Machine learning, Data mining, OOP, AOP, Networking, CICD,  bla bla bla
* DevOps - AWS, GCloud, CICD (Jenkins, Travis, GoCD), ELK stack, openLDAP, Ansible 
* Frameworks : Laravel, Spring, Flask, Jekyll, NodeJS, React, Hibernate

Too lazy to write all i think i know, check out my CV :point_down:
